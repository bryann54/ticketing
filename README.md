Ticketing App
A modern, cross-platform ticketing application built with Flutter. This project leverages best practices in state management and navigation to provide a seamless and professional user experience, from splash screen to authentication.

âœ¨ Features
Splash Screen with Auth Check: A beautifully animated splash screen that intelligently checks the user's authentication status and navigates to the appropriate screen without a noticeable delay.

State Management with BLoC: Utilizes the BLoC pattern to manage application state, ensuring a predictable and testable flow for user authentication.

Declarative Navigation: Implements AutoRoute for a clean and type-safe approach to navigation, simplifying the routing logic.

Dependency Injection: Uses GetIt for managing dependencies, promoting a decoupled and maintainable codebase.

Environment Management: Integrates flutter_dotenv to handle environment-specific configurations (e.g., API keys, development flags) securely.

Internationalization: Supports multiple languages using Flutter's built-in localization and a custom LocaleProvider.

Responsive UI: Designed to work seamlessly on both light and dark themes and adapt to different screen sizes.

Create a .env file in the env directory.

Add your necessary environment variables. For a basic setup, you might have something like this:

# .env
API_URL

For development, use env/.dev.env and for release, use env/.env.

Running the App
Connect a device or start an emulator.

Run the app from your terminal or IDE:

flutter run
